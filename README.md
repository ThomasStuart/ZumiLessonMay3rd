# ZumiLessonMay3rd

<br>  
Goals:  <br> 
1.) perform a more complex route with the graphs we create.  By that I mean a route that has more than 3 directions  <br> 
<br> 
2.) create a graph of your own <br> 
<br> Minimum requirements: <br> 
	A.) at  least 5 nodes <br> 
	B.) at least 5 edges <br> 
<br> 
Maximum requirements:<br> 
	C.)  no more than  10 nodes <br> 
	D.) no more than  10 edges  <br> 
<br>  

3.) understand why the search function does not work with graphs/maps with different edge/road lengths   <br> 


** if we finish all the above early, we will begin to incorporate obstacle avoidance into our code.  So when Zumi is on a route, if we put our hand in front of Zumi, Zumi will stop until the hand remains in front, and then continue to the destination.
