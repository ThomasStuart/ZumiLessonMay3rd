# ZumiLessonMay3rd

<br>  
Goals:  <br> 
1.) perform a more complex route with the graphs we create.  By that I mean a route that has more than 3 directions  <br> 
2.) create a graph of your own <br> 
3.) understand why the search function does not work with graphs/maps with different edge/road lengths   <br> 

<br>  
** if we finish all the above early, we will begin to incorporate obstacle avoidance into our code.  So when Zumi is on a route, if we put our hand in front of Zumi, Zumi will stop until the hand remains in front, and then continue to the destination.
